# Notetaker
An AI-Powered Notetaker

# How to use
Install required modules:
Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

After installing dependencies, run ./host.sh in the source directory to host the server.

* This may not work if you are on Windows or Mac. If you are, you can instead run notetaker.py directly after installing the dependencies.
